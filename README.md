# SQL_RETAIL_SALES_PROJECT
Project Overview
Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis
Database: projectsql

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. 

Objectives
Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
Project Structure
1. Database Setup
Database Creation: The project starts by creating a database named projectsql.
Table Creation: A table named retail_sales is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.
2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
3. Data Analysis & Findings
   
 #1. COUNTING TOTAL SALES FOR EACH CATEGORY.  
 #2. FIND THE AVG AGE OF CUSTOMER WHO BOUGHT FROM BEAUTY CATEGORY.  
 #3. FIND ALL THE TRANSACTIONS THAT WHERE THE TOTAL_SALE IS GREATER THAN 1000.  
 #4. FIND THE TOTAL NO. OF TRANSACTIONS MADE BY EACH GENDER IN EACH CATEGORY.  
 #5. CALCULATE AVG SALE FOR EACH MONTH.  
 #6. ONLY SHOWING TOP 2 MONTHS OF EACH YEAR.  
 #7. FINDING TOP 5 CUSTOMER BASED ON THE HIGHEST TOTAL SALES.  
 #8. FIND THE NO. OF UNIQUE CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED ITEM FOR EACH CATEGORY.  
 #9. WRITE A SQL QUERY TO CREATE EACH SHIFT AND NUMBER OF ORDERS (EXAMPLE MORNING <=12, AFTERNOON BETWEEN 12 & 17, EVENING >17).  
 #10. FIND TOTAL_SALES IN EACH SHIFT.  
 #11. FIND TOTAL_TRANSACTION IN EACH SHIFT.  

 Findings
  Customer Demographics: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
  High-Value Transactions: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
  Sales Trends: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
  Customer Insights: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.
Conclusion
   This project cover database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive 
   business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
